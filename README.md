# QR-Generator
This is a backend Node.js project that generates QR codes from user-provided URLs. It uses the inquirer package to prompt the user for a URL, the qr-image package to create the QR code image, and Node.js's fs module to save both the generated QR code (qr-img.png) and the entered URL (URL.txt).
